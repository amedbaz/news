 "akurti":"series of mountain ranges in northwestern Africa, running generally southwest to northeast to form the geologic backbone of the countries of the Maghrib (the western region of the Arab world)—Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. They extend for more than 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometres),from the Moroccan port of Agadir in the southwest, to the Tunisian capital of Tunis in the northeast. Their thick rim rises to form a high sill separating the Mediterranean basin to the north from the Sahara to the south, thus constituting a barrier that hinders, without completely preventing,communication between the two regions. Across the mountains filter both air masses and human migrations. It is, however, only in the east–west direction that the Atlas Mountains facilitate movement. These are the conditions that create at the same time both the individuality and the homogeneity of the Atlas countries.Although the Saharan region is more likely to be described as the archetypal North African habitat, it is the well-watered mountains north of this vast desert that provide the foundation for the livelihood of most of the peoples of North Africa and a striking green or white background for many North African towns.",

 "akurti":"Mount Arvon, peak, Baraga county, northern Upper Peninsula, Michigan, U.S. Reaching an elevation of 1,979 feet (603 metres), it is the highest point in the state. It lies about 12 miles (20 km) east of L’Anse, inland from the Lake Superior shore in a wilderness recreational region of lakes and streams that includes Baraga and Craig Lake state parks west and southeast (respectively) of the peak. The Huron Mountains, extending for about 20 miles (30 km) along the southern shore of Lake Superior, are close by to the northeast. Also nearby is Mount Curwood, which long was considered Michigan’s highest point.",

 "akurti":"Hekla, active volcano, southern Iceland, lying within the country’s East Volcanic Zone. It is Iceland’s most active and best-known volcano. The volcano is characterized by a 3.4-mile- (5.5-km-) long fissure called Heklugjá, which is active along its entire length during major eruptions. Lava flows issuing from this fissure have contributed to the volcano’s elongated shape. Hekla stands 4,892 feet (1,491 metres) above sea level 70 miles (110 km) east of Reykjavík, the capital, at the eastern end of the island’s most extensive farming region.",
